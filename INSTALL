Dabo - Some brief installation notes.

PREREQUISITES:
+ Python (we recommend 2.7.3 (Python3 not supported in wxPython yet)
+ wxPython UNICODE BUILD (we recommend the latest, currently 2.8.12.1)
+ MySQLdb (only to run the demos or for your project)
+ reportlab (only to run reports)
+ PIL (only to run reports) (also known as Imaging or the Python Imaging Library)


INSTALLATION:
Windows: run 'win_setup.bat'
Mac or Linux: As root or administrator, execute the following shell command:
    python setup.py install

That's it! 


OTHER STUFF:
There are two other directories in the same folder as this file: 'demo' and 
'ide'. They contain useful programs (written in Dabo, of course!) to help
you explore and develop with Dabo. You should move these to a convenient 
folder on your system, such as 'My Documents\Dabo' on Windows, or '~/dabo' on 
Linux or Mac.

The 'demo' folder contains the DaboDemo application, which shows off a lot of
the cool things in Dabo. This is still a work-in-progress, with more demos
being added all the time. Be sure to check the website for updates!

The 'ide' folder contains our visual tools, such as the Class Designer, which
you can use to visually design your UI; the connection editor ('CxnEditor'),
which is used to create connections to database servers, as well as several 
other useful visual tools.

HAVING PROBLEMS?
But... if you have trouble installing, and for whatever reason the setup.py 
doesn't work, just add a file named 'dabo.pth' to your site-packages directory,
with the path to dabo e.g. '/home/pmcnett/projects/dabo'.

If you are on Linux and got the following error:
error: invalid Python installation: unable to open /usr/lib/python2.6/config/Makefile (No such file or directory)

and you really want to get setup.py to install dabo for you, you need to
install the python-dev package. For instance (on Debian):

apt-get install python2.6-dev

(assuming you are running python2.6; change the version number as appropriate).

There are some problems with some of the third-party libraries like PIL when
running in a mixed 32/64 bit environment, such as Mac OSX. While everything
can be made to work running 64-bit versions of everything, if you are having
trouble it may be worth trying to install 32-bit Python, wxPython, etc. Note:
to run python in 32-bit on Mac, use python-32 as the command instead of python.

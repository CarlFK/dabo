Dabo - Some brief installation notes.

PREREQUISITES:
+ Python (we recommend the latest, currently 2.5)
+ sqlite3 (comes with Python 2.5) or pysqlite2 (install separately)
+ wxPython UNICODE BUILD (we recommend the latest, currently 2.8)
+ MySQLdb (to run the demos)
+ reportlab
+ PIL (also known as Imaging or the Python Imaging Library)

INSTALLATION:
As root or administrator, execute the following shell command:
	python setup.py install

That's it! 

But... if you have trouble, and for whatever reason the setup.py doesn't
work, just add a file named 'dabo.pth' to your site-packages directory,
with the path to dabo e.g. '/home/pmcnett/projects/dabo'.

If you are on Linux and got the following error:
error: invalid Python installation: unable to open /usr/lib/python2.4/config/Makefile (No such file or directory)

and you really want to get setup.py to install dabo for you, you need to
install the python-dev package. For instance (on Debian):

apt-get install python2.4-dev

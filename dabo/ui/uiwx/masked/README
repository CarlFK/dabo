This is a temporary holding place for a masked edit control provided by
Vladimir Sekissov. I'd love to get this masking functionality built in
to dTextBox, ideally using a property such as InputMask which when left
at None or blank does the default masking for the given datatype, but that
can be overridden by setting the property.

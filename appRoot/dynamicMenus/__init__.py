''' Dabo: dynamicMenus module

    Put all dynamic menu definitions in this directory, making 
    sure to preceed their names with "menu", as in:
    
    menuFileOpen.py

    Each definition is a dictionary, with optional list(s) which
    represent submenus. The appropriate places within Dabo will
    pull from these files to fill the menu items at the right
    time(s).
    
    ToDo:   specify the format of a menu def file here, including 
            all available options and settings.
    
    For now, just use existing definitions as boilerplate I guess...

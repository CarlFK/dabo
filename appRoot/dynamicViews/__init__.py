''' Dabo: dynamicViews module

    Put all dynamic view definitions in this directory, making 
    sure to preceed their names with "vr_", as in:
    
    vr_invcats.py

    Each definition is a dictionary, containing all the information
    necessary for Dabo to construct the SQL statement.
    
    ToDo:   specify the format of a view def file here, including 
            all available options and settings.
    
    For now, just use existing definitions as boilerplate I guess...
    
    DaboWiz, which doesn't exist except as an idea in this lowly
    Dabo developer's mind, will take the drudgery out of this. It 
    will do it for you, at least get you started with a file you 
    can tweak, instead of forcing you to create the file by hand.
    
    All in good time, Jedi Master.

##pkm: Here are some open items:

+ datanav:

	+ editing new records results in those edits being lost. This 
	  could be a datanav issue, but may be a base dCursor issue.

	+ date/datetime fields can't be edited: None will get sent back
	  to the database, resulting in a NULL value for the field. Again,
	  at this point we don't know if this is datanav or dCursor.

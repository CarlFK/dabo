See the Subversion log for all the details.

Current:

Improved test framework for uiwx. Now you can run ui/uiwx/test.py and get
almost all of the dabo controls in one form, and they are the same tests 
that you get when you run an individual control directly.

Dabo user settings are no longer saved to .userSettings.ini in the app
directory, but are saved to the user's home directory (in ~.dabo/) or
if on Windows, in <User Profile>/Application Data/Dabo/.

Support for SQLite added. As of this moment, Dabo supports all major 
open-source database backends: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Firebird, and SQLite.
Next on the list should be Oracle, Sybase, and MS-SQL.


Dabo-0.4 (2005-08-08) (Revision 1132):

Cleaned up the initialization of properties. No more initStyleProperties();
user code just puts their props in initProperties() or sends them to the
constructor in the properties arg or as separate named arguments. The
framework sorts out when the properties need to be set in the object
construction cycle.

Improved sizers by separating out the Halign and Valign properties, 
eliminating the need to use the 'alignment' flags parameter. Added the 
'Parent' property, making it easy to reference the control that 'owns' 
the sizer. Also added the convenience method 'append1x(item)', which is 
shorthand for writing 'append(item, 1, "expand")', since it is used so 
frequently. The grid sizers now have 'isRowGrowable()' and 'isColGrowable()'
methods for checking the status of any row/column.

New dGrid, with dColumn and Header objects available for reference.

Lots of convenience functions written, such as those designed for simplified 
access to common dialogs, are now built into the dabo.ui module. Examples: 
getFile(), getColor(), getBitmap(), and the getString() functions, which all 
create, show and destroy the required dialog window, and then return the 
result. So, to present the user with a font selection dialog, just call 
dabo.ui.getFont(), and the selected font will be returned (or None if they 
canceled). Similarly, to show a common messagebox and get the response, 
just use dabo.ui.info(), dabo.ui.stop(), or dabo.ui.areYouSure(). 

doDefault() much faster now (thanks to Alex Martelli)

Support for decimal.Decimal.

New classes: dColorDialog, dToolBar.

Work on the report writer and report designer progresses. The report designer
is now in the daboide project, not here in dabo anymore.

We finally have distutils support. To install Dabo, do the standard
"python setup.py install". Thanks to limodou for submitting the patch.


Dabo-0.3.2 (2005-03-21) (Revision 959):

Work continued on the Dabo report writer and report designer. The
writer will now read and write the rfxml file format, and will do some 
simple reports. The designer will edit the rfxml files, again, with simple
formats. This isn't ready to use yet but the foundation is in place.

cursorToXML() added.

Encoding property added to databases.

dBitmap introduced.
dWizard introduced.
dTreeView introduced.

dGrid is being refactored, and is almost done. For a short time, it can
be found as dGridX.

We worked hard trying to get window closing not to segfault on Windows, 
to get icons to display correctly on Mac, and to optimize Dabo in some key
bottleneck areas. We've greatly improved Dabo's performance on all platforms,
and Dabo now behaves less differently on each platform.

Improved data binding: controls don't need to bind to a bizobj, but to any 
object expression.

Improved Firebird and PostgreSQL support.

Lots of improvements and bug fixes, in all three tiers.


Dabo-0.3.1 (2005-02-16) (Revision 802):

Separated creation of dCursor from dBizobj.
Added option to automatically create a dPanel in dForm.
Further Daboized dListControl.
Fixed display of a few of our icons on Mac.
Added bindKey() method, which binds a keycombo like "Ctrl+D" to a function.
Daboized dMenu, dMenuItem, and dMenuBar.
Minimal Tkinter (dCheckbox) working again (testing only).
Added ActiveControl property to dForm.
Various dSizer improvements were made.
We moved various things to better places in the source tree.
Connection info now saved in XML format.
Localization framework added. Courtesy Vladimir Sekissov.
Added Children property, which contains a list of a container's children.
dCommandButton is now known as dButton.


Dabo-0.3 (2005-01-10):

New UI controls added:
    dFileDialog.py
    dListBox.py
    dListControl.py
    dSplitForm.py
    dSplitter.py

GridSizer added. Method calls to all sizers greatly simplified.

Menus simplified, removing wx-specific calls.

My favorite UI debugging tool: getMouseObject()

Framework classes now consistently use the standard initialization 
methods: initProperties, initEvents, etc.

Child requeries and transaction support added to bizobj

Bizobjs now support the relationSpecs.rsxml format for adding child 
relations.

Support for fulltext-type searches by word added.

Auxiliary (one-shot) cursors added to main cursors for better support 
of different backends.

Improved unicode support in cursors.

Added support for PostgreSQL. Added template to ease creation of new 
backend support scripts.

appWizard: added support for parent/child/grandchild/... relationships; 
improved FieldSpecEditor.

appWizard/dDataNav* classes:
    changed all wx.Sizers to dSizers
    added "-ignore-" to visually indicate search criteria that will not be used
    added save/restore of values on search page.
    added 'Matches Words' option for fulltext searches
    fixed bugs with searches for boolean values

Controls:
    Now auto-name themselves. Unique name enforcement added.
    Added _IsContainer attribute to distinguish controls that can add other controls to themselves.
    Added support for setting colors by name instead of RGB tuple.
    Fixed resizing bug that would not allow a resized object to be made smaller.


Dabo-0.2 (2004-09-20):

Continued improving FireBird database support, improved MySQL support. Added
preliminary SQLite support.

Save passwords encrypted.

Added logger objects to send program output to, instead of directly to stdout.

Began abstraction of Tkinter at purely an experimental level.

Added some new controls, such as a better date control and a combo box. 

Brought in some Foxpro string functions from the openfox project.

New event model, greatly simplifying the binding of events, the raising of events,
and the subclassing of events to define new events.

Added preliminary unicode support to the cursor level.

Dabo 0.1.1 (2004-06-13):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r330 | ed | 2004-06-13 05:44:35 -0700 (Sun, 13 Jun 2004) | 6 lines

Re-wrote the __setNonUpdateFields() method to be backend-agnostic. Also
reduced the number of separate queries that were being run: previously, a
query was run for each field in the cursor; now just one query is run, and
the results are determined from that. Got to polish my list comprehension
skills in the process <g>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
r329 | ed | 2004-06-12 14:41:02 -0700 (Sat, 12 Jun 2004) | 11 lines

Removed the direct access of the cursor's native rowcount and rownumber
properties, and replaced it with protected attributes __rownumber and
__rowcount. Made the properties RowNumber and RowCount to get and set these 
properties.
Also updated the SQL builder code to simplify the creation of the SQL
statement.
NOTE: the code recently added to use the cursor's description to determine
non-updatable fields contains MySQL-specific code. Will have to test this
with Firebird to make sure that the 'description' is correctly returned, and
that the limit clause is correctly rendered.

Refactored getCursor() up to the base dBackend class, since the change Paul
just made for dbFirebird.py also works fine for dbMySQL.

Fix dbFirebird.getCursor() to not hardcode the class mix, as it wasn't necessary.
All I needed to do was to pass the connection instance to the cursor constructor.

Modify dSqlBuilderMixin to return the correct limit clause based 
on the backend in use. Firebird uses 'select first 1000...' while
MySQL uses 'select ... limit 1000'.

Add rownumber class variable to dCursorMixin which provides a
temporary solution to the AttributeError when dbFirebird is the
backend.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Change default __params value to the empty tuple in dBizobj. Since different
backends expect different types for the params arg, modify dCursorMixin.execute
to not send the params arg at all if it is None or otherwise empty. Tested with
MySQL and Firebird: Ok.

Modified dbFirebird's getCursor() to do the required mixing-in and to return
a full Dabo cursor instance. dbFirebird now gets past all the initial errors
in my wiz-generated test app. Next up: there is MySQL-specific code in my
dPageDataNav code - dbFirebird is currently choking on the LIMIT clause.

Modified dProgressDialog to properly react to exceptions that happen in the
passed function. It used to be that if an exception happened in the requery()
code, the dProgressDialog wouldn't handle it and therefore the worker thread
would never return control back to the main thread. Now, control is returned
and the main thread tries to show useful information about the exception. It
is a start at least.

Abstracted the actual creation of the cursor into the specific backend
objects. They will be passed the class of cursor to create; if they have an
interface for specifying a cursor class, as MySQLdb does, it can be used; if
not, it can be ignored.

Interim commit. Firebird is closer to working.

Add a connection reference to the dBackend object.

Update getLastInsertID() code to take advantage of a feature commonly added
to the various dbapi's that automatically saves the last insert id for us.
MySQL has this feature; Firebird does not.

Add some convenience functions to dBackend (with thin wrappers in dCursorMixin):
	+ getTables(): list of tables in the database
	+ getTableRecordCount(): count of records in the table
	+ getFields(): list of field names and field data types for the table

	Note that the field data types are expresses in fox-like 'I', 'N', etc.
	format. This is because there aren't a sufficient number of Python types
	to express all the possible database types (memo versus string, etc.)

Firebird barfs with execute(sql, params=None), but both MySQL and Firebird can
handle params=() so I made that generic change.

Added code for the cursorMixin to set its own superCursor reference if one
isn't supplied. This will help in cases where this mixin class is used
independently of the bizobj, which normally supplies that reference. Also
wrapped references to the BackendObject property so that errors will not be
thrown if this hasn't been set. If a developer wants to use this mixin
outside of the framework, they will have to be responsible for setting this
reference if they need to use any database-specific features.

MySQLdb-specific implementation. The new property is named '_records', and
is created by calling 'fetchall()' after the query is executed.

Refactored the db classes to abstract out the backend-specific code into
separate classes. There is now nothing MySQL-specific in the code (except,
of course, the dbMySQL.py script!). Adding support for additional backends
now will require adding a script for that backend's specific needs, and also
an additional 'elif' statement in dConnectInfo.py. I changed to an if/elif
structure instead of the eval() syntax because the this no longer requires
that the database code be in the dBackend.py file, and the code no longer
relies on naming conventions to work.

dBizobj: 
- changed a single cursor reference to a list of cursors, keyed on parent
key. For independent cursors, this key is simply None.
- modified all methods to support this new cursor design.
- created read-only property 'Cursor' which will return the current cursor.
- removed getRowNumber(), setRowNumber() and getRowCount() methods. Replaced
them with the properties RowNumber and RowCount.
- removed temp PK generation and management. Moved that logic to the cursor
class.
- there is now isChanged(), which only tests the current row, and
isAnyChanged(), which tests the entire recordset.
- save(), cancel(), etc., no longer accept an 'allrows' parameter. Instead,
there are new saveAll(), cancelAll(), etc. methods to be called.
- added scan() function which takes a function that will be called once for
each record in the current recordset.
- added setChildLinkFilter() method, which tells the child bizobjs which
cursor to use as their current cursor when the parent record changes.
- added getChangedRecordNumbers(), which will return a list containing the
record numbers of all records for which isChanged() returns True. Since the
change might be in a related child record, a record number may appear in the
list even though none of its fields have changed.
- added getRecordStatus(), which accepts a record number as a parameter
(default=current record). Will return a dictionary containing an element for
each modified field. The field name will be the element key, and the element
value will be a tuple whose zeroth element is the original value, and whose
first element is its current value.

dCursorMixin:
- temp PK support is now handled here instead of the bizobj.
- getPK() will return the temp PK for a new, unsaved record
- implemented getRecordStatus() - see bizobj notes above.
- fixed bug introduced into the SQL update statements wwhen datetime support was
added.

dSqlBuilderMixin:
- added childFilterClause, to handle auto-filtering of child record sets by
the parent FK.

dForm:
- removed references to 'allrows' in save(), cancel(), etc., and replaced
them with the appropriate methods (saveAll(), etc.)

dConstants:
- added constant for the temp PK field name

Add newlines and tabs to the output SQL in SQLBuilderMixin, as it makes
it easier on the eyes for SQL debugging purposes.

Add property dForm to all Dabo objects. Analagous to THISFORM in VFP, it
will always contain a reference to the form. 

Add dGrid, a generic grid based on dControlMixin so it is a dObject. It 
implements its own DataSource property as it doesn't inherit from 
dDataControlMixin. Make dGridDataNav inherit from this new dGrid. Over
time, I may move some behavior from dGridDataNav into dGrid if it seems
like the behavior would apply to general dGrids.

Make dForm.getBizobj() descend into the child bizobj hierarchy to find
the referenced dataSource. Previously, only top-level bizobjs as registered
with dForm.addBizobj() were searched.

Add properties SelectPageClass, BrowsePageClass, EditPageClass, and
ChildPageClass to dPageFrameDataNav, which allows for easy user-overriding
of the pages in the dFormDataNav framework. Add property DefaultPagesOnLoad,
which turns on/off the default select/browse/edit/child pages.

Introduce dDateControl, a composite control for editing date values. It is
very crude, but it did work in my test - it kept in sync with the bizobj.

Modify update and insert code in dCursorMixin to properly format dates for

comments regarding MySQL-specific code.

Tested working with dates in the UI and saving to MySQL, and it seemed to

dSecurityManager to pass on informative messages during the login

Add logged-in user name to the caption of the main form. Display 
the application name in the caption of the login form.

Move the ordering of app instantiation steps around somewhat so that
the login form displays before the main form. Now, you only get to 
see the main form after a successful login.

Base dDialog on dFormMixin, which lets it harness some useful form 
properties.

Corrected really stupid bug in the cursor mixin where the _blank dictionary
was being added to the result set, instead of a copy of it. This meant that
changing the new record changed the 'blank' template, and subsequent new
records were just adding new references to the same dictionary.

Added support for temp PKs for new records. Child records will get those
temp PKs as their linked FKs. Work still needs to be done when saving a new
parent record to ensure that its new PK is propagated down to its new
children.

Introduce dSecurityManager, which handles validating a user login and caching
group membership information. Introduce property SecurityManager to dApp 
object, allowing users to subclass dSecurityManager to do what they need it 
to do, and then attach an instance of their subclass to dApp. 

Make dApp check with the SecurityManager if available, before starting the
main application event loop.

Introduce new UI class dDialog, which is a very simple frame usually meant
to be shown modally and to return a value. Introduce new UI class dLogin, 
which is a basic login form.

Wrap some property docstrings in _(). 

Start experimenting with Accelerator Tables, which can be used to workaround
the lack of Cancel and Default properties in command buttons.

Create common ancestor object for all dabo objects, and christen it
'dObject'. Not all Dabo objects inherit from this yet, and perhaps not
all ever will - there is little reason for dCursorMixin to inherit from
it, for example. The intent was for there to be some commonality in the
public interface for all Dabo objects.

Move some of the more common stuff out of ui/uiwx/classes/dPemMixin and
into the new common/dObject.

Add docstrings to the properties in dabo.db.dConnectInfo.

Rename dGrid to dGridDataNav, as it is really not meant as a general
grid control but rather to fit in with the dFormDataNav subframework.
It assumes that it is a member of a dPageDataNav, for instance. At 
some point, we'll want to define a basic dGrid which dGridDataNav will
inherit, but the grid is one of the most complex UI controls so it'll
have to wait for now.

Add new property, FormType, to dFormDataNav. There is 'Normal', which 
is a normal form with Select/Browse/Edit/n childview pages; 'PickList' 
which doesn't display the edit/childview pages and is intended to be
used to pick a record from a lookup; and 'Edit' which isn't implemented
yet but will only display the edit page(s) for the record with the 
given pk value.

Add new event, EVT_ITEMPICKED, for use by dFormDataNav when instantiated
as a picklist.

Make dGrid behave differently in several places, depending on whether 
its form is a picklist or a normal nav form.

Make the picklist form close upon a keypress of Escape. Make the toolbar/
navigation menu display only the appropriate items depending on FormType.

Define a childBehavior dict in dFormDataNav, which lets subclasses 
define certain things about how the childview page(s) will behave. Note
that this isn't how I want it to stay, this was just to get up and
running. Eventually, users will be able to easily subclass all of the
separate components of dFormDataNav, not merely the form itself, and
there will be appropriate hooks where they can put their code.

Update the childview page to add and delete child records. Editing child
records isn't implemented yet. Note that until the non-unique pk problem
is fixed as discussed this morning, weird things can happen when adding
child records, especially more than one of them, and it will fail if you
try to add child records to a newly-added parent record.

hopefully not give the diff of deleted files. So, if it worked, there
should not be a diff for the deleted dGrid.py.)

Modified the cursor to handle calculated and derived fields that are not to
be included in updates to the backend database. The cursor mixin class has a
user-editable list property called 'nonUpdateFields', and there is a private
list property named '__nonUpdateFields' that is set by the cursor mixin
after each requery. For most cases, the built-in behavior should suffice to
prevent illegal update statements resulting from trying to update a derived
field. The user-configurable property is there to allow the user to specify
additonal fields to be ignored during an update.

The list of user-defined non-updatable fields is set by the bizobj's
'NonUpdateFields' property. Accessing the NonUpdateFields property will
return the concatenated list of the public and private non-update lists.

Also fixed a bunch of edge conditions dealing with the fact that until a
query is run, the cursor doesn't have many of the attributes that were
expected, such as _rows, rownumber, etc.

Add property dApp to dPemMixin, a reference to the dApp application object

Make dApp inherit from PropertyHelperMixin and DoDefaultMixin to conform
to most of the rest of the Dabo objects.

Add property AutoNegotiateUniqueNames to dApp, default True. When true,
if an object tries to name itself identical to a sibling, a unique name
will be found by appending an integer at the end. When false, a NameError
will be raised which was the previous behavior. 

The auto-negotiation of names is definitely implicit, and could potentially 
cause confusion when debugging problems. Consider:

	self.addObject(dabo.ui.dCheckBox, 'myCheckbox')
	self.addObject(dabo.ui.dCheckBox, 'myCheckbox')

No errors would have been raised, and two checkboxes got created, but 
the second checkbox got a name that differs from the name specified by the
programmer ('myCheckbox1' instead of 'myCheckbox').

I think the convenience outweighs the concerns about implicitness, but 
would be willing to change the default to False instead of True, which may
be better as the programmer would have to explicity tell dApp to act
implicitly, and presumably understand the consequences by doing so.

Removed the calls to requeryAllChildren() and afterPointerMove() from the
bizobj. Added those calls as an option to the seek() method.

The first two methods are "for internal use only", and should never be called from
an app. They exist so that the bizobj can move the pointer to where it needs
to be without triggering a slew of additional effects. 

moveToPK() is only used in a requery() to try to restore the record pointer
to the PK of the record it was on before the cursror was requeried. It is
followed by a call to requeryAllChildren() and afterPointerMove() in that
method; calling it again from this one is just inefficient..

moveToRowNum() is called by the validate() method so that a bizobj can check
all of its records. You don't want it requerying its children, as they will
need to be validated separately, and will be called in turn.

In VFP Codebook, these methods are protected. For record pointer movement
from within an app, the public methods first(), next(), etc., should be used
to move the record pointer.

Since seek() is intended to be called both internally and from developer's
code, I've added a parameter 'runRequery' which defaults to False. If this
value is passed as True, requeryAllChildren() and afterPointerMove() will be
called if the cursor moves the pointer.

Bugfix: refactor old pre-dException code in dBizobj.requeryAllChildren().

Tried to change default of dBizobj.RequeryOnLoad() to False instead 
of True, but look at that it was already set to False. I guess I 
slipped this in before and forgot. I'll fix the demos.
	
Recently, when we started forcing unique sibling names, I made the
constructor append the id of the control to make the name unique if
needed. I've improved this somewhat by making it an auto-incrementing
integer instead (txt1, txt2, txt3, etc.).

Add event handlers OnCreateWindow and OnDestroyWindow, and bind them 
to EVT_WINDOW_CREATE and EVT_WINDOW_DESTROY for all controls.

Add new dEvent, EVT_VALUECHANGED, and raise this event whenever a
control's value changes, whether programatically or interactively.

Add new function getAbsoluteName() to dPemMixin, which returns self's
fully-qualified name, such as 'dFormRecipes.dPageFrame.Page1.txtName'.

Remove the property list for the form being output to the shell, which
was causing problems on Windows and isn't necessary anyway.

Refactor some of the Select page in dFormDataNav, and make the select
checkboxes and textboxes persist their values to the user settings 
table. Now the select page will remember what you last searched on
and present it to you for convenience.

Actually, that persisting of values that I use in the select page is
now available for all data controls, by setting the new property
SaveRestoreValue.

The user can use bizobj.validateRecord() in a couple ways: 
	1) return errorMessageText, and dBizobj will raise the exception
	2) raise the exception itself.
In case #2, None is returned, resulting in an exception in dBizobj.
This code fixes that.

If a user were to requery, and then answer yes to save changes, but 
the save failed, the requery would happen anyway, wiping out all 
their changes. This code fixes that.

There are still some funky problems though. Do this:
	1) add a new record and save
	2) add a new record and make the bizrule fail.
Note that the bizrule error text is listed twice, and that the browse
screen has reverted the original successfully-saved record back to the
value it had when it was new.

for you, knowing that we aren't encouraging passing values to the

their own subclassed pages.

Handle NoRecordsError in dBizobj.getParentPk().

Childviews in dFormDataNav use dGrid in the childview pages just like in
the main browse page. Add logic so that when new/edit/delete is selected
in the popup menu, it gets directed to the proper place.

Raise NameError if user code tries to set a dObject's Name property to 
a sibling's name. If this happens inside the init phase of the control, the
error won't propagate up but the object will get assigned a new name 
instead.

Make control's init's call private methods _beforeInit() and _afterInit()
instead of the user-code beforeInit() and afterInit() hooks. This is to 
offer a level of guarantee that the basic stuff happens even if the user
forgets to doDefault(). _beforeInit() and _afterInit() now call the user-
code hook methods.

Add initChildObjects() hook, which is where daboDesigner should put its
addObject() code. Called from dPemMixin._afterInit().

Refactor the API of dBizobj, making most of the 'properties' into actual
Python properties complete with getters, setters, and docstrings. Here is
a list of the new bizobj properties:

	Caption (new: friendly name for communicating with the user)
	DataSource (was dataSource)
	SQL (was sql)
	RequeryOnLoad (was noDataOnLoad)
	AutoPopulatePK (was autoPopulatePK)
	Parent (was _parent)
	KeyField (was keyField)
	LinkField (was linkField)
	ErrorMessage (was _errorMsg, and I think this one can go because of the exception-refactor)
	RequeryChildOnSave (was requeryChildOnSave)
	NewChildOnNew (was newChildOnNew)
	NewRecordOnNewParent (was newRecordOnNewParent)
	FillLinkFromParent (was fillLinkFromParent)
	RestorePositionOnRequery (was savePosOnRequery)

Obviously, I've FUBAR'd the original API so all the demos that use bizobj's 
will have to be changed, which I'll do after lunch.

Refactor getPropertyList() and getPropertyInfo() out of dPemMixin and into the
new dabo.common.PropertyHelperMixin, since these functions can be useful at a
lower level than our wx interface. Make dPemMixin and dBizobj inherit from
PropertyHelperMixin, which means that dBizobj can now theoretically be represented
on the designer and have its properties edited there.

Add beforeInit() hook to dBizobj, which allows the user code an opportunity to 
modify properties such as RequeryOnLoad before they take effect.

dBizobj.__setattr__ had old-style class code that was causing my new property API
to fail silently, and it drove me crazy for an entire hour at least. :)  Changing
to the new-style super() call for non-cursor field attributes fixed the problem.
Lesson learned: __getattr__ will be called only after the attribute was not found, 
while __setattr__ gets called before Python looks for the attribute at all. Sounds 
like a subtle difference on paper but the implications are huge!

Add method getChildren() to dBizobj, which returns a tuple of object references
to the children. 

Add icon childview.png, which represents a child bizobj in the runtime dFormDataNav.

In dFormDataNav, delay instantiation of the pageframe until the primary column def
has been assigned, which allows the childviews to appear in the nav menu and in the
page frame.

The UI for the child view stuff isn't working yet, but it is a little closer. I started
out this morning working on that and got sidetracked with the bizobj changes.

Make changes to BackColor do an implicit self.Refresh(), as it appears to 
be necessary with most controls, although it appears that dEditBox needs to
actually be recreated...

The borderstyle thing isn't working right, as different controls have different
default borders. For instance, dEditBox with no border style flags set has a
simple border, while dPanel does not. Add a 'Default' setting to let the value
get set back to that control's default (no border flags set).

Make dBizobj inherit from DoDefaultMixin. Add an afterInit() hook in

			# Pass the error back to the UI

			return False
		
Since nothing else is being done except re-raising the error, I simplified
these by taking out the try block completely. The error will propagate back
to the UI by default anyway.

Fix bug in dBizobj: moveToRowNum() and moveToPK() were not requerying the
child bizobjs nor calling the afterPointerMove() hook.

Put a couple try blocks in dGrid and dDataControlMixin.

Modified the reCreate() method to better assign properties. There are still
some artifacts to work out that mostly involve property assignment order;
for example, the method was restoring the Left, Right, and Width properties
in such a way that controls were being moved every time they were
re-created. I added some extra code to handle this, but there are some
similar problems with fonts that need to be addressed.

I left in a line that prints out all failed property assignments, so that we
remember to handle these exceptions.

Fix some bugs in dOptionGroup.

Experimental: I'm actually scared at how easy this was to implement, but I added
a reCreate() function to dPemMixin, so now any object can reinstantiate itself
by calling self.reCreate(). The intent is really for the daboDesigner to be able 
to reinstantiate an object at will, such as when a property changes that won't
take effect at runtime, such as Alignment, BorderStyle, PasswordEntry, and all the
useful properties of dOptionGroup.

Increase robustness of property setters by coercing proper data types
and raising exceptions with improper values.

Fix a few places where my strategy for setting/deleting window style
flags wasn't up to snuff.

Add 'showInDesigner' key to the getPropertyInfo dict. This tells the 
designer whether to show the property at all. Set WindowHandle, Size,
and Position to not show in the designer.

Add 'preInitProperty' key to the getPropertyInfo dict. This tells the
designer where to put this property setting in the class's source code.
Some properties need to be set before the object is fully constructed,
while most need to be set after the object is fully constructed. Set 
the few properties I know about that need to be defined early.

Add some editorInfo overrides to some properties, where the defaults 
wouldn't be adequate. For instance, the default for integers is -65536
to 65536, which is completely inappropriate for properties like Width
and Height, which can't go below 0.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
r188 | paul | 2004-04-21 14:16:36 -0700 (Wed, 21 Apr 2004) | 22 lines

Separate out the property initialization, based on whether the property
needs to be passed as a style parameter to the constructor (property will
be read-only at runtime), or whether the property must be set after the
object is fully instantiated (property will be read/write at runtime 
unless specified differently in the property assignment).

Add getPropertyInfo() to dPemMixin, which returns a dict of useful information
on the passed property name, including the data type, the editor to use, and 
the docstring. This is to make the designer much more generic: it can just
query the object for most of the information it needs.

Part of the logic of the above involves checking for the editor to use by
calling a special method which is named similarly to the given property.
If that method doesn't exist, a default value for editor info is returned, 
based on data type, which is how I've left it for most of the properties.
The only properties I've specifically defined editors for so far are the ones 
that have a set number of choices to be presented in a list, such as 'Alignment'.

Add property 'AutoResize' to dLabel.

Fix some properties to work correctly. This was after testing with 
dTextBox in daboDesigner. I need to figure out how to deal with the 
styles that have to be passed to the constructor, not altered after the
object has already been created (Alignment, for example). I'm thinking
that we'll have to get a copy of the object's properties, destroy it, 
and then recreate it.

Make dLabel not auto-resize to the length of the text. Fix a couple minor
bugs.

Add the following properties, most of which are saved in the WindowStyleFlags
and so otherwise would be kind of difficult to use:

dCheckBox:
    .Alignment (left, right)
    
dEditBox:
    .Alignment (left, center, right)
    .ReadOnly
    
dLabel:
    .Alignment (left, center, right)
    
dPageFrame:
    .TabPosition (top, left, right, bottom)

dSpinner:
    .SpinnerWrap (does the value wrap from low to high, and vice-versa)
    .SpinnerArrowKeys (can the user spin up/down with the keyboard)
    
dTextBox:
    .Alignment (left, center, right)
    .ReadOnly (like Enabled=False but allows text selection)
    .PasswordEntry (if True, echoes asterisks instead of Value)

All forms:
    .BorderResizable
    .ShowMaxButton
    .ShowMinButton
    .ShowCloseButton
    .ShowCaption
    .ShowSystemMenu
    .TinyTitleBar
    
All controls and forms:
    .BorderStyle (none, simple, raised, sunken)
    .WindowHandle (platform-specific Hwnd)

Note that in most cases I haven't tested any property interactions yet, but 
in theory they should all work. Some of these won't work on live objects, so
in the future when integrating with the designer we'll probably have to recreate
the object after some of these properties change. My feeling is that most testing
of the properties can wait until the designer is instantiating these controls, at
which point we'll have a convenient interactive testing environment.

Note also that I chose to skip over some possibilities, such as making a 3-state
checkbox control and some other styles that only work on this or that platform.
We can revisit these in the future and choose to put them in, but my feeling is
that if it doesn't apply to all platforms, it shouldn't apply to any platform.
Keeping Dabo at the lowest common functionality will reduce surprises and headaches
for our users later, when they try to port their app from Windows to Mac.

Fix Linux segmentation fault and Windows Fatal Error c0000005 that
was happening on destruction of the main frame. This appears to be
a problem way down in the bowels of wx that I exposed with yesterday's
addition of the dPemMixin.__getattr__() code, which was doing a
self.GetName() to be able to display the name of the object in the
raised AttributeError exception. I think the base C++ object is 
already destroyed which resulted in GetName() segfaulting. My workaround
saves self.GetName() to _name at opportune times, and __getattr__ uses
the value of _name for the AttributeError.

        def afterInit(self):
            print "afterInit"

General skim/review of everything in dabo/ui/uiwx/classes. This led to
some rearranging of things:

In general, I fixed the import statements to import into private namespaces
instead of into the module-global namespace. 'Namespaces are good', I think,
is the quote on the back of our PyCon 2004 shirts. :)  Seriously, this is 
much safer as we don't risk separate modules stepping on each other's names.

The way I had it, dPageFrame and dPage were not base-class-like, in that
they both tied in intimately with dFormDataNav. I made new dPageFrame and
dPage base classes, with just basic behavior that would apply to all
subclasses, not just the data nav form. I then subclassed dPageFrame
to create dPageFrameDataNav, and I subclassed dPage to create dSelectPage,
dBrowsePage, and dEditPage. 

I fixed some naming issues inside some of the page classes.

There was still some old-Dabo cruft in dMainMenuBar, which I removed.

Switched to the new-style super(class, instance).method() style of 
running the parent-class behavior wherever possible.

Added a commandbutton to the test.py script.

There is an inconsistency in dBizobj.isChanged() versus dCursorMixin.isChanged().
dBizobj's docstring states that it is going to just check the current record, while
dCursorMixin's docstring states it will check all records, which is what it does.

I didn't change the docstrings, but I did add an allRows argument to both of these
functions, along with logic in dCursorMixin to act appropriately based on the 
parameter. I made the default value of these arguments match the docstrings, so
allRows=False in dBizobj, and allRow=True in dCursorMixin.

Changed the name of dLocalize.loc() to dLocalize._() to match the il8n conventions,
but loc() still works as well. Changed dForm's loc() calls to _() calls.

Added a 'save changes' prompt to dForm.requery() when there are unsaved changes,
allowing Yes/No/Cancel choices.

Set more property definitions in controls and forms, matching up wx 
get/set functions to VFP property naming styles. One good side
effect is that you can now always refer to self.Parent to get the 
containing object. As soon as only dControls are in use everywhere,
we'll be able to say 'self.Parent.Parent...'. Next, I'll probably add a 
self.Form property which would be analagous to VFP's ThisForm.

Make messagebox's center themselves on top of the active form, not on 
top of the top level form.

Make the main menu bar appear on all forms, which is more Linux-like. This
should have no effect on Windows where there is just one main menu bar on the
parent MDI form but I have yet to test that.

Remove extraneous getSQL() from the bizobj, now that getSQL() is a 
passthrough to the cursor's sqlbuilder.

I found another example in dCursorMixin where we catch all exceptions
and then raise dError. This isn't right, as we want the actual exception
to propagate up to the global error handler, not to hide it.

Remove sqlBuilder from dFormDataNav, as it is now exposed in the bizobj.
Set up the requery function in the select page to interact correctly.

Remove all the old stuff from my prior incarnation of Dabo, as it is all
pretty much reimplemented now on a much stronger platform.

Introduction of dPemMixin, which provides a way to define properties of
dControls and map them to wx behavior. For instance, you can now set the
size of a text box by calling:
    textBox.Left = 12
    textBox.Top = 20
Not only will this make it easier to provide other UI interfaces (qt, etc.)
while still keeping the property names consistent, but it should also make
it easier to define subclasses of the dControls, once we have the resource
format all worked out. Also, VFP'ers will feel right at home using familiar
property names instead of having to remember wx's function syntax every time.

Make dControlMixin and dDataControlMixin inherit from dPemMixin.

Make dDataControlMixin define a few extra properties, as these are items
that our users are highly likely to want to interact with (DataSource,
DataField, and SelectOnEntry).

With this commit, even more of Dabo is dependent on wxPython 2.5, as I've
used Python new-style classes in the mixins and wxPython 2.4 will fail
when trying to use new-style mixins.

Add dError.BusinessRuleViolation exception.

Ran into issue with adding a new record in recipes, and it turns out to
be because I coded dSqlBuilderMixin to format the sql nicely with newlines
but this regex in dCursorMixin.__setStructure():
        pat = re.compile("(\s*select\s*.*\s*from\s*.*\s*)((?:where\s(.*))+)\s*", re.I | re.M)
doesn't account for the newlines, so it doesn't find the where clause. Rather 
than figure out that regex, it was easier just to take the newlines out of 
dSqlBuilderMixin for now.

In dCursorMixin.new(), we were catching all exceptions and then raising
dError, which inappropriately hides unexpected exceptions. Better just to
take the try block out and let the unexpected exceptions propagate up. Until
I did this, I wasn't seeing the cause of my problem (first, it was that 
global name 'sql' isn't defined in __setStructure, and then it was a MySQL
exception having to do with bad SQL because the second where clause: 'where
1=0' was tagged onto the end.

Add 'value' and 'stringMatch' selectTypes to the select page auto generation
of controls.

Fix problem in dGrid that I introduced recently where after the row number in
the bizobj changes the grid's currently highlighted row wasn't changing.

Fix a stupid error made in dGrid last commit, which resulted in phantom rows
in the grid when the next dataset is empty and the previous dataset had
rows. Upon testing, it was apparent there was absolutely no reason for my
previous change so the fix was easy. :)

Set focus to the grid on browse page activate (the code is strange but it is
the only way I could find to get it to work).

Make requery more convenient by selecting the browse page after a requery when
the active page is the select page.

Add NoRecordsError and QueryError, and raise those exceptions from dCursorMixin
instead of the generic dError. Rework dForm to import dError into a separate
namespace instead of into the global namespace. I think this should be done
for dCursorMixin as well. Rework dForm to act appropriately upon these specific
exceptions.

Fix some minor things in dGrid - problems would occur if there weren't any 
records in the dataset.

Make the select page make select option fields based on the columnDefs dict
in dFormDataNav. This is the same source of columns for grids and fields to
display in the edit page. Re-route dFormDataNav's requery() function to call
the select page's requery(), which sets the where clause of the SQL and then
ultimately calls dForm.requery(). Currently, this SQL gets manipulated in 
dFormDataNav's sqlBuilder, but I think ultimately this sqlBuilder needs to 
be mixed-in to either dBizobj or to dCursor - somewhere 'lower down' than
the UI. 

Update dDataControlMixin to recognize that there isn't a current record, as
when there are no records in the dataset, and to disable itself and set its
value to blank. Conversely, when it recognizes that there is current data
it will enable itself.

Started implementing the select page.

While working on that, I discovered that in 2.5 the 
setfocus/killfocus code wasn't running in the controls
on the edit page, and remembered that Ed mentioned 
something like that the other day. The common factor
must be GTK2 versus GTK1, and it came down to adding
event.Skip() in the form's SetFocus code - I had just
added SetFocus/KillFocus code in the form on my airplane
ride. 

Tested this in wx2.4/GTK1 as well as in wx2.5/GTK2.

It sure is hairy how my changes may work fine on 
my computer yet break something on another computer. I
guess that is what we get for developing multi-platform
using the native toolkits on each platform.

By the way, event binding will be much simpler in 2.5,
as they've introduced the form:

   self.Bind(wx.EVT_SET_FOCUS, self.OnSetFocus)

to bind events to methods, which feels a lot like VFP's
BINDEVENT() does it not?

In 2.5, image lists must contain images of exactly the same size,
something that wasn't enforced in 2.4. Resized a few images to
conform. Also, by default image lists start with one image in the
list, not zero. This caused a segfault in 2.5.

Modified dBizobj's __getattr__ and setattr__ so that you can now refer to field values as if they were attributes of the bizobj, and setting these attributes will automatically update the cursor.

field value and clicked 'save' without first
setting focus to a different control, their

Work on menus. Add a 'navigation' menu to 
dForm and keyboard shortcuts to actions
such as 'save', 'next', 'prior'. Add 
keyboard shortcuts for navigating the pages
in the pageframe as well. Alt+1 activates
the first page, etc.

The SimpleFormWithBizobj is more interesting
now.

Next up: data browsing/picking grid and 
data navigation toolbar.

Added dLocalize script to base of trunk. This is the wrapper that will
enable localization of all displayed strings in the framework. Simply add
the declaration 'from dabo.dLocalize import loc' to the top of your file,
and then wrap all displayed strings as follows:
   orig: self.addToErrorMsg("No Records Found")
   new:  self.addToerrorMsg(loc("No Records Found"))
 
Right now, loc() simply returns the original string. But at some point in
the future, we will need to design a localization procedure for our
non-English users.
 
Also: refined the validate() method of the bizobj so that it can process
the entire record set, or just the current record.

Change dForm to inherit from wx.Dialog instead
of wx.Frame, which is I believe the correct thing
to do since 1) tab traversal works and 2) the 
dForm becomes a true child of the main frame
and there is only one entry in the taskbar. 
Before, every dForm that got instantiated would
appear as a separate 'app' in the taskbar.

Integrated a basic dFormMain which inherits from
wx.Frame.

Fix requery(): when passed a param value of (), a
MySQL exception was raised complaining "Not enough
arguments in format string". I don't know if this
is the right fix, but it does make requery() work.

This I only noticed after implementing dForm.requery()
as dBizobj.requery() sends _params to _cursor.requery
and by default _params is (). In the bizobj init, the
bizobj.requery() is bypassed completely, just calling
_cursor.requery() directly with no parameters.

Fix some little buggers in dCursorMixin.cancel():
  + wasn't iterating through all rows (was missing row 0)

  + cancel() was defining a recs list, but then iterating
    through all recs anyway. What I did still isn't correct
    as it still iterates through all records but then
    filters out the ones that don't exist in recs. There
    is a mismatch in that delete() expects an index and
    not a rec instance, and I wanted to leave that detail
    to Ed to work out.

  + __cancelRow() was just changing the value of the field
    back to the value of the field, and not to the value of
    the memento. This still isn't correct as dCursorMixin
    shouldn't be directly accessing dMemento._snapshot but
    at least it works now.

Make dForm know how to get the fieldVal from the
bizobj and return it to the control. Make dControl
know how to ask the form for the value and refresh
itself.

Update testAll in ui/uiwx/classes/test to add a 
bizobj (the bizZip) to the test form. Now when
testAll is run, textbox values are updated when
the vcr is used for navigation.

Next up is probably to implement save and cancel
functionality at the dForm level. Also, the dControls
are notifying the dForm when the user changed the
value, but the dForm isn't notifying the bizobj
yet.

I keep starting other work and then coming back to
Dabo. Not very good on the pocketbook... :)

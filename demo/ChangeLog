dabodemo-0.6 (2006-03-27) (Revision 396):

Added demos for table creation (thanks Echo).

Added a test for dynamic properties.

Added the dSplitter demo, provided by Brandon Singer. Adjusted demo.py 
to allow dSplitter objects in addition to dPanels.

Added a report demo, showing variables, groups, rectangles and lines,
and a detail band of dynamic height.

Added a variation of the basicForm.py tutorial that uses a form class definition instead of an on-the-fly creation of the form.

Fixed Bubblet to use the new screenshot capability. Also updated the README file.

Added some more visual feedback for both the MouseEnter and MouseLeave events.



dabodemo-0.5.1 (2006-01-25) (Revision 375):

Added code to put the record pointer on the current preset id when choosing
a new preset, as a user-interface convenience (minesweeper).

Reworked much of Montana. It is now working and behaving on all platforms.

Minor fixes to the wxPython-demo.


dabodemo-0.5 (2005-11-29) (Revision 342):
Fixed some minesweeper bugs.

Added some simple demos to show specific techniques and features.

Added a wxPython-demo, which mirrors the wxPython demo but in Dabo code.

Revamped Bubblet with more current Dabo-esque code.


dabodemo-0.4.2 (2005-10-07) (Revision 303):
Montana and Minesweeper games improved and more playable, in particular the use
of dToolbar with new game/end game, and a timer on a button. Montana and
Minesweeper both have help dialogs now too.

Minesweeper now saves high scores to a public database, and uses a bizobj to
do this. 

Added field-validation tutorial. Added field-validation to the SimpleBiz demo.
Added tutorial showing the new auto bind event feature.


dabodemo-0.4.1 (2005-08-30) (Revision 270):

Minesweeper demo game is greatly improved, and now playable on all 
platforms. Added a way for users to set game preferences based on
the contents of a public game definition database, or by tweaking
the settings manually. The mine squares are now individual dPanels
instead of dButtons, which works better multi-platform.

Montana card game demo added. This demo uses dBitmapButtons to 
display the cards and react to user events, and is quite addicting
to boot. Also, it demonstrates the use of a LIFO stack for the
unlimited undo/redo functionality.

Both games show off dToolBar.

SQLite support added to the SimpleFormWithBizobj demo.

Minor changes made to several demos to keep them up to date with 
the current "Dabo Way".


dabodemo-0.4 (2005-08-08) (Revision 242):

Added a couple more simple demos to the tutorial, including one which
lets you specify a datasource and sql statement on the command line, and
then browse the resultset in a Dabo dGrid control.

Ongoing fixes and updates to the other demos.


dabodemo-0.3.2 (2005-03-21) (Revision 226):

Minesweeper is playable on Mac now. 

Added comment to SimpleFormWithBizobj to allow easy switching between
MySQL, Firebird and postgresql samples.

Added a new demo app for 1:M tables.


dabodemo-0.3.1 (2005-02-16) (Revision 212):

Fixed some bugs, and kept dabodemo in line with current dabo.
Added a sample dSecurityManager to the recipes app.


DaboDemo-0.3 (2005-01-10):

The appWizard was moved to the new daboide repository, which can be
found at svn://paulmcnett.com/daboide.


DaboDemo-0.2 (2004-09-20):

Added Bubblet game demo, which is written in Dabo but doesn't connect to data.

New wizard for generating applications, called appWizard.py. This replaces the old
wizMaintenanceApp.py. Has the feature that the field specifications are saved separately
from the form definition, in xml format.

The demos in general have gotten more dabo-like, and less wx-like, as dabo has gotten
to a better level of abstraction. It is not as necessary to 'import wx' in your code
these days.

Added a Python code editor and dubbed it 'dEditor'. Put it in a new directory 
dabodemo/daboIDE. This editor, based on Scintilla, features everything you'd expect:
syntax coloring, auto-indent, zooming, line numbering, call tips, and auto-complete. It 
represents the beginning of an effort to bring a simple multiplatform IDE to Dabo, 
which will be a central place to work on Dabo-based projects. A project manager, a 
good set of editors (code, field specs, database definitions, report layouts, ui 
layouts, etc.), an interpreter, a debugger, and quick links to documentation will 
all be provided.

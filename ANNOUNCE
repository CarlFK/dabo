Announcing Dabo 0.1

Dabo is a Python module, allowing for easy construction of 3-tier desktop
applications for distribution on Mac, Windows, and Linux. The design allows
easy separation of the database from the business logic from the user-
interface. It should appeal to Windows developers, specifically Visual FoxPro
and Visual Basic developers, as both principal authors come from a Windows
database appdev background.

The database layer can be used independently from the rest of Dabo, as can the 
UI layer provided you don't require any data-awareness. But the real strength 
comes with using Dabo as your entire framework, complete with the dApp application
object. 

Dabo is dual-licensed. You may download it and use it for free under the GPL,
which would allow you to distribute it for free with your GPL projects, or you 
may purchase licenses for distribution with commercial or proprietary applications.
We are also considering offering a FOSS Exception, which would keep your non-
GPL'd Free and Open Source projects from getting infected with Dabo's GPL 
license.

There is no warranty provided with Dabo, it is provided 'as-is'. Dabo is currently
in a pre-alpha state of development. There is currently no official documentation,
other than the source code.

Dabo runs on Unix, Linux, Macintosh OSX, and Windows (all flavors).

Currently, the only supported database backend is MySQL, but in the near future
all dbapi databases will be supported, including PostGreSQL, Oracle, and MS-SQL.

Currently, the only supported user-interface library is wxPython, but in the 
distant future we may support others, including PyQt, TkInter, Curses, and
HTTP.

The primary means of support is provided through the dabo-users mailing list, 
to which you may subscribe by visiting:

Dabo may be downloaded from the following link:

We invite you to participate in the development of Dabo. The source code is available 
from our Subversion repository, so you'll need to install the Subversion client from 
http://subversion.tigris.org. The repository can then be downloaded by issuing the 
following command:

svn checkout svn://paulmcnett.com/dabo/trunk dabo

In addition to the main dabo project, there are three other Dabo-related projects in 
various states of development:

svn checkout svn://paulmcnett.com/dabodemo/trunk dabodemo
svn checkout svn://paulmcnett.com/dabodesigner/trunk dabodesigner
svn checkout svn://paulmcnett.com/dabodoc/trunk dabodoc

You'll also want to subscribe to the dabo-dev mailing list by visiting:

http://leafe.com/mailman/listinfo/dabo-dev. All development conversations are had
there, and commit notifications are sent there. You may submit patches to that 
address as a text attachment in svn diff format.

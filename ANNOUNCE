<Date of Announcement>
Announcing Dabo <Version>, a framework for 3-tier desktop applications.

Dabo is a Python module, allowing for easy construction of 3-tier desktop
applications. The 3 tiers are:

    + The database, which can be any database with available dbapi modules.
      Currently, Dabo only supports MySQL, but we intend to support very
      soon:
      
        + MySQL (already supported)
        + PostgreSQL
        + PySQLite
        + Microsoft SQL Server and MSDE
        + Oracle
        
      This module abstracts the details of getting a database connection and
      acquiring a recordset. SQL can be built piece-by-piece, allowing for
      easy dynamic where clauses, for example.
      
      
    + The business object, which abstracts the interaction with the database
      tier and enforces business rules as set by your application code. Users
      of the Codebook Framework for Visual Foxpro will feel right at home with
      Dabo's bizobj class, as it uses the exact same API in most cases.
      
      
    + The user interface, which can be any of several GUI's available for use
      with Python. Currently, Dabo only supports wxPython, but we have left 
      open the possibility of supporting:
      
        + wxPython (already supported)
        + tkInter
        + PyQt
        + curses (text-UI could be useful for servers)
        
      
      Dabo provides a host of useful UI base classes, including bizobj-aware
      forms, data-aware controls (textbox, editbox, spinner, checkbox, etc.),
      message boxes, and a data-browsing grid with incremental search built-in.
      

The database layer can be used independently from the rest of Dabo, as can the 
UI layer provided you don't require any data-awareness. But the real strength 
comes with using Dabo as your entire framework, complete with the dApp application
object. 

Dabo is dual-licensed. You may download it and use it for free under the GPL,
which would allow you to distribute it for free with your GPL projects, or you 
may purchase licenses for distribution with commercial or proprietary applications.
There is no warranty provided with Dabo, it is provided 'as-is'.

Dabo runs on Unix, Linux, Macintosh OSX, and Windows (all flavors).

The primary means of support is provided through the dabo-users mailing list, 
to which you may subscribe by visiting:

Dabo may be downloaded from the following link:

To participate in the development of Dabo, you'll need to install the Subversion
source control system, available at http://subversion.tigris.org. The repository
can then be downloaded by issuing the following command:

svn checkout svn://paulmcnett.com/dabo/trunk dabo

In addition to the main dabo project, there are three other sub-projects in various
states of development:

svn checkout svn://paulmcnett.com/dabodemo/trunk dabodemo
svn checkout svn://paulmcnett.com/dabodesigner/trunk dabodesigner
svn checkout svn://paulmcnett.com/dabodoc/trunk dabodoc
